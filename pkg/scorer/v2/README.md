## Week-3 task(in progress)

What we have done far now:

- Added all the features of extractors such as `CompWithLicenses`, `CompWithValidLicenses`, `CompWithDeclaredLicenses`, `SBOMDataLicense`, `CompWithDeprecatedLicenses`
- Added test for SPDX and CDX
- TODO:
  - `CompWithRestrictiveLicenses` isn't working.
